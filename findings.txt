    Cleaning up unnecessary files and moved logo from public to src.
    We only have index.js and app logo inside src folder. Under public folder, we just have index.html
    Now, doing npm start, we see errors(Since we removed a few files and changed location of logo)
    We removed additional imports from index.js file. We see
    root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
    </React.StrictMode>
    );
        Used to identify potential issues in web application. Does not render anything that's not visible on UI.
        Will give warnings and errors on UI.

    Removed unnecessary code present in index.html
