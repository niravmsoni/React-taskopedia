     Created this new app using this command - https://create-react-app.dev/
21.
    For running project, execute "npm start".
    Opens up application against "localhost:3000"
    For stopping the npm execution, press ctrl + C and enter 'Y'

    Cleaning up unnecessary files and moved logo from public to src.
    We only have index.js and app logo inside src folder. Under public folder, we just have index.html
    Now, doing npm start, we see errors(Since we removed a few files and changed location of logo)
    We removed additional imports from index.js file. We see
    root.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
    </React.StrictMode>
    );
        Used to identify potential issues in web application. Does not render anything that's not visible on UI.
        Will give warnings and errors on UI.

    Removed unnecessary code present in index.html 

23.
    Under index.js > root.render(), adding <div>Hello World!</div>
    We did not need to add any manual js, babel libraries for this project. npx react app did that job for us
    All dependencies can be seen in package.json project

24.
    For displaying fancy items, need to write basic HTML into root.render(<HTML gos here>)
    For adding header and footer, move existing code to function.
    Created a function/component namely MainBody() and we can call it inside root.render(<MainBody />) tag
    FIRST LETTER MUST ALWAYS BE CAPITAL. USE PASCAL CASE FOR REACT COMPONENTS
    Under .render(), there must always be 1 parent element
    The function that was used here is known as a COMPONENT

26.
    Components can be nested. Like Parent/Child components etc.

27.
    Created nested components using functions in react.

28.
    JSX Rules:
        Component names - Pascal Casing
            function Footer(){} -> <Footer/>
        Props must be camel casing(MaxLength and ReadOnly in below example)
            <input maxLength={5} readOnly='false'>
        Inline style is an object os it must be enclosed in double curly brackets
            <p style={{color: "gray", }}>Happy Coding!</p>
        Integer in props go in {} and "" will be string and bool goes in {}
            <input maxLength={5} readOnly={false} placeHolder="Ben"></input>
        'Class' NEEDS to be replaced with 'className'(Since class is a reserved keyword)
            <h1 className='heading1'>
